# Manual Installation (if Library Manager fails)

1. Download libraries from GitHub:
   - MAX3010x: https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MAX3010x_Sensor_Library
   - MLX90614: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MLX90614-Library
   - TinyGPSPlus: https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus
   - ArduinoJson: https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson
   - Base64: https://github.com/Densaugeo/base64_arduino

2. Extract to Arduino libraries folder:
   - Windows: Documents\Arduino\libraries\
   - Mac: ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/
   - Linux: ~/Arduino/libraries/

3. Restart Arduino IDE

# Verification

After installing libraries, verify in Arduino IDE:
- Sketch > Include Library > (check if all libraries are listed)

Compile test:
- File > Examples > SparkFun MAX3010x > Example1_HeartRate
- Verify it compiles without errors
